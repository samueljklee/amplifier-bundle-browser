  Check a service's status page for incidents or outages.
  
  WHY BROWSER IS NEEDED:
  - Status pages are often JS-rendered (Statuspage.io, custom React apps)
  - `curl` returns empty template, not actual status
  - Need to see the visual indicators (green/red/yellow)
  - Incident details may be dynamically loaded
  
  Try: curl https://status.vercel.com - you'll get a JS shell, not the actual status.

# Usage:
#   amplifier tool invoke recipes operation=execute \
#     recipe_path=@browser:recipes/examples/check-status-page.yaml \
#     context='{"status_url": "https://status.openai.com"}'

inputs:
  status_url:
    description: URL of the status page to check
    type: string
    required: true
  services:
    description: Specific services to check (optional, checks all if empty)
    type: array
    default: []

steps:
  - id: check-status
    agent: browser:browser-operator
    prompt: |
      Check the status page at {{status_url}} for any incidents or issues.
      
      ## Instructions
      
      1. Navigate to {{status_url}}
      2. Wait for the page to fully render (status pages are often JS-heavy)
      3. Screenshot: status-page.png
      
      4. Extract the following information:
         - Overall system status (operational, degraded, outage)
         - Individual service statuses
         - Any active incidents with their:
           - Title/description
           - Affected services
           - Start time
           - Current status
         - Any scheduled maintenance
      
      {% if services %}
      5. Specifically check these services: {{services}}
      {% endif %}
      
      6. Look for any recent incidents (last 24-48 hours)
